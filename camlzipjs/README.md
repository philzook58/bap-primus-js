This works?
Color me confused.
Oh Zip files are not compressed at the directory level. Maybe that's why

Ok, but the error is happening in camlzip

We're open_in a file
and then we're copy_entry_ it


utimes_r But why isn;t that crashing?

Oh my god.
There was a catch all errors situation that was crashing again in the close channel point.
Why was the channel closed at this point though?


Let us reasses:
Sometimes the missing primitives may not be rethrown property
You can search inside the javascript files for error strings if it doesn't give you a normal crash
You can console.trace() to figure out what is going on. Move around and console.log to get a feel
--pretty and --source-map-inline --debuginfo are pretty important

Try to build minimal version of problem. Once I had that I was off to the races.
